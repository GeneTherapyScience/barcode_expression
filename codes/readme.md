# Tools to analyze WSN/stg data of barcoded cells
## bin/
- checkWSN.py : Check percentage of WSN barcodes in the input data.
- compare_data.py : Compute correlations (Pearson/Spearman) between two dataset of barcode-reads.
- count_NG.py : Count reads of decendants of initial irregular stg.
- count_mut_barcodes.py : Count variations including stg mutations, for each environments (NT, DTX, Sp). Inputs are generated by `stg_tables.py`.
- count_mut_barcodes2 : Similar to `count_mut_barcodes.py`. Count variations `k` samples (`k=0,1,2,....`) of which include stg mutations, for each envirionment.
- extractWSN.py : Delete lines starting with non-WSN barcode.
- filter_wsnstg.py : Keep barcodes given to stdin, in each `.wsnstg` file given in command-line.
- generate_commonbarcodes_table.py : Reads & ratios of barcodes, included in the reference file.
- generate_JSD_table.py : Make tables of Jensen-Shannon Divergence, between different samples in a same clone.
- included.py : Extract lines of barcodes included in the reference.
- judge_stg.py : Give `OK` to template-originated stg, and `NG` to others.
- make_wsn_list.py : Make a list of wsn's, included both in the plasmid and in any of the clones.
- matchuniqhamm2.sh : Merge barcodes within Hamming distance 2 in `.uniq` files, using `merge_readerror.py`.
- merge_readerror.py : Merge barcodes by Hamming/Levenstein distances in wsn & reads list.
- mutpos.py : Make histogram data of stg mutations at each position.
- pickwsnlen.py : Extract lines with barcodes of 28-32 of length.
- pickwsnlen30.py : Extract lines with barcodes of length 30.
- sam2pair.py : pipe `.sam` data to `.wsnstg` data.
- sam2wsnstg_batch.py : Generate `.wsnstg` files from `.sam` files.
- seq_distribution.py : Show distributions of distances between barcodes.
- singleread_percentage.py : Show read-based ratio of single-read barcodes.
- start_end_reads.py : Output increment/decrement of reads of each barcode, from Day0 to Day7/Day14.
- stg2stgmixd.py : Add mixd & distance data to stg list.
- stg_reads_corr.py : Output tables of Pearson/Spearman correlations between reads & mutations.
- stg_tables.py : Make mutation data table from .wsnstg files.
- stg_valid_barcodes.py : Extract barcodes included in all of the reference & given datafiles.
- survey_orphans.py : Give nearest barcodes & distance for some sampled barcodes.
- survey_orphans2.py : Give how many barcodes are within given radius, for some sampled barcodes.
- take_subset.py : Make a random-extraction without replacement, from a dataset given to stdin.
- wsnstg2mutinfo.py : Make `.mutinfo` files including basic mutation data for each barcode, from `.wsnstg` files.
- wsnstg2stg.py : Make `.stg` files including reads, WSN variations and MIXD alignment for each stg sequence, from `.wsnstg` files.
- wsnstg2white.py : Remove strange (not originated from the template) stg's from wsnstg files, making `.white40.wsnstg` files.
- wsnstg2wsn.py : Make `.wsn` files from `.wsnstg` files, merging all stg's per wsn.
- wsnstg2wsnmixd.py : Make `.wsnmixd` & `.indelinfo` files from `.wsnstg` files.

- analyze_data01.py : Library to load wsn-stg data from datafiles.
- barcodelib.py : Library of functions used in many scripts.

## utils/
- mannwhitneyu.py : Carry out Mann-Whiteney U-test for input data from stdin.
- random_barcode.py : Generate list of random WSN barcodes.
- random_variations.py : Simulate variations after incubations.
- showprogress : Show the last lines of given files.
